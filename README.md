# Hello, i am Adam

I am interested in Object Oriented Programming languages for example C++, C# and Java. I did some applications using Xamarin forms too. I like tidiness inside code. Programming for me is something like sugar for kids.

Good programmer is not someone who create program almost without bugs. Good programmer is someone who respect more than these five rules knowledge, goals, culture, design patterns and tidiness and based on that can create program almost without bugs.

## High school
The year is 2012 i've started studying High School of Informatics of Electrical Engineering and Crafts Ro≈ænov pod Radho≈°tƒõm.

I've started to program in C# it was the first language i've met. It was the major the milestone of my life.

Before i finished this school i did mi first relatively big project in C#. It was 2D topview game, with items, character specifications and so on. This project was mine graduation thesis.

While studying at this school, I've decided to be a programmer because it filled and entertained me. I've decided to study software engineering on the Brno University of Technology in the last year of High school.

## University
The year is 2016 i've started studying on the the Brno University of Technology. It was really hard for me and for my psyche but i've finished this school at 2020.

The third year was hard i did it all but there was the term thesis, i've got it all done by the plan. My head said me that i should have to do it better and i should have more then there was written inside the plan, so he kicked me off. I decided to finish the term and start to work. I've had all subject complete, except term thesis.

The next school year i've started to do new Bachelor thesis. I've worked and did Bachelor's thesis at the same time. The Bachelor's thesis excited me. This was the first time i've met convolutional neural networks, i had to study all about it because at the bachelor's degree we didnt have subject for (convolutional) neural networks. I've finished in 7 2020 for me it was a big celebration. The day of the degree examinations was really nervous mine opponent was dean of this University he praise me for thesis and i've been really happy for that.

I've decided to leave the University and stay in work and improve myself in specific way.
